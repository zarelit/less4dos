Una riga fittizia
Altra riga riempitiva
If a packet hits a pocket on a socket on a port, and the bus is interrupted at a very last resort, and the access of the memory makes your floppy disk abort, then the socket packet
pocket has an error to report.
If your
cursor finds a menu item
followed by a dash,
and
the
double-clicking icon puts your window in the trash,
and your data is corrupted cause the index doesn't hash, then your situation's hopeless and your system's gonna crash!

If the label on the cable on the table at your house, says the network is connected to the button on your mouse, but 
your packets want to tunnel to another protocol, that's repeatedly rejected by the printer down the hall......

And your screen is all distorted by the side effects of gauss, so your icons in the window are as wavy as a souse; then 
you may as well reboot and go out with a bang, 'cuz sure as I'm a poet, the sucker's gonna hang.

When the copy on your floppy's getting sloppy in the disk, and the macro code instructions is causing unnecessary risk, 
then you'll have to flash the memory and you'll want to RAM your ROM, and then quickly turn off the computer and be 
sure to tell your Mom!
