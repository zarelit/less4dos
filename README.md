# A `less` implementation for DOS

I was tired of not being able to scroll back a file when using `more` in DOS. This project is ** not suitable ** for production, it's a program made for a class project and thus is written in x86 assembly.

## Assemble
The program is made to run under 16bit DOS, all files must be assembled with MASM5 and then linked together

## Run
Simply run `less` followed by the text file to open.
